# Concentration bounds library

* concentration_bounds: fixed sample size confidence bounds on the mean.
* concentration_variance_bounds: fixed sample size confidence bounds on the standard deviation.
* empirical_concentration_bounds: fixed sample size confidence bounds with data-dependent estimators rather than fixed parameters (e.g the variance in Bernstein bound is estimated from the data instead of being prior knowledge).

To install : pip install concentration_lib https://pypi.org/project/concentration-lib/

To test : python -m pytest
